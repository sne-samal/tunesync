# tunesync
## Project Introduction:
tunesync is a web application built using django and react js, it makes use of material ui components and icons
It allows users to join a room via a room code and collectively listen to music provided by the host.
Users can vote to skip the current playing song and can optionally play/pause the music.
The host can customise the room settigs, they can:
- Determine whether other listeners can pause or play the song
- Control how many users' votes are required to skip the song
Once the number of votes required to skip has been achieved, the song is automatically skipped to the next one on the queue.

## Credit:
This project was used as a learning experience to understand basics of Django and how a react application can be built with it.
Credit goes to Tech with Tim and his playlist on this project. The playlist is 2 years old so some of the methods used in the videos are outdated. In particular, the use of class based components, the majoirty of which have been now replaced, by me, with functional components and hooks. I have done my best to update any other outdated methods used in the playlist as well.
